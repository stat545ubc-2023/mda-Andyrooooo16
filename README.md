## How can I run code that appears in this folder/GitHub repository?
*Note: To run code from GitHub, you must have Git installed on your device. The [STAT545A class website](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/notes/notes-a00/) contains instructions on how to do this if you need to do this and are not familiar with the process. Please scroll down to "Step 3: Git and Github" at the bottom of the page.*

To run code from this GitHub repository, you will need to either download it or clone it.

##### Cloning
To clone the repository, click the green **Code** button and copy either the HTTPS or the GitHub CLI. Then, open Terminal and change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory. You can then type "git hub" followed by the URL you copied earlier (i.e., *git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY*), before pressing **Enter** to create your local clone. For more detailed instructions, please visit this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository?platform=mac).

##### Download
To download the repository, click the green **Code** button and, in the menu that appears, click **Download ZIP**. The entire repository will be downloaded to your device as a zipped file. 

Should you only want to download a specific file, go to file and click the **Raw** button. This opens the raw code in your browser. You can then right-click the page and select **Save asâ€¦** so that you can name the file and choose where to save it on your device.
